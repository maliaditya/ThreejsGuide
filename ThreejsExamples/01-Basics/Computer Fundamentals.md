## Browser Process & Memory Execution Model

**What the diagram clarifies:**
- How does the browser start executing when you click its icon, and how does it become multiple processes?
- Where does `requestAnimationFrame` run, and how is it synchronized with rendering?
-  Where does the JavaScript `window` object actually live, and how is it connected to the DOM?

## Window
## It clarifies **where (0,0) actually is in the browser**

- Origin **(0, 0)** is at the **top-left corner** of the content area
- **x increases → to the right**
- **y increases ↓ downward** (not upward like math graphs)
